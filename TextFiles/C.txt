Easy to learn, impossible to master
Node is so easy to learn. Especially if you already know some Javascript. Google a few beginner tutorials, play with Express and you’re off to the races, right? Then you realize you’ll need to settle on a database. No problem, lets search NPM. Oh, theres a handful of decent SQL packages. Later you realize all the ORM tools suck and a basic driver is your best bet. Now you’re stuck implementing redundant model and validation logic. Shortly after that, you start writing more complex queries and start getting lost in callbacks. Naturally you read about callback hell, chop down your christmas tree and start using one of the many promise libraries. Now you just “Promisify” all the things and grab a beer.
All this to say that it feels like the Node ecosystem is constantly moving. Not in a good way. New tools that “trump” old tools seem to come out daily. Theres always a new shiny thing to replace the other. You’ll be surprised on how easily this happens to you and the community seems to encourage it. You use Grunt!? Everyone uses Gulp!? Wait no, use native NPM scripts!
Packages that consist of trivial code no more than 10 lines of code are downloaded in the thousands every day from NPM. Seriously!? You need a dependancy for array type checking? And these packages are used by some huge tools such as React and Babel.
You’ll never master something that moves at break-neck speed, not to mention the potential of dependancy instability.
